# Codex adapter for ironlint. Gates `apply_patch` edits via Codex's PreToolUse
# hook — see the 2026-07-02 codex adapter design spec under specs/.
#
# Codex's block contract is unlike the exit-code hooks:
#   ALLOW = exit 0 with EMPTY stdout.
#   BLOCK = exit 0 with a permissionDecision:"deny" JSON on stdout.
# An exit code NEVER blocks; malformed stdout FAILS OPEN (the edit lands). So
# every block path emits well-formed deny JSON (via jq, with a static fallback)
# before exiting, and the script never dies between "decided to block" and
# "emitted".
#
# stdin: {"tool_name":"apply_patch","cwd":"...",
#         "tool_input":{"command":"*** Begin Patch ... *** End Patch"}}
# arg1 (the hook event name) is accepted and ignored.
