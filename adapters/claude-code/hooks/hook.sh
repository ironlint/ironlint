# Claude Code adapter for ironlint.

# Gates Write/Edit/MultiEdit/NotebookEdit edits via the PreToolUse hook. Claude
# Code hands us the proposed content *before* the write lands, so this script
# builds it in-process and pipes it to `ironlint check --file <path>
# --content -`:
#   - Write:        tool_input.content is already the post-edit content.
#   - Edit:         old_string -> new_string applied to the current on-disk file.
#   - MultiEdit:    the edits[] array folded sequentially onto the on-disk file
#                   (each edit against the post-previous-edits content), mirroring
#                   Claude Code's own apply semantics so what we gate == what it
#                   would write.
#   - NotebookEdit: the edited cell's new_source (delete removes a cell — nothing
#                   to gate, so it's allowed).
# Exit codes map onto Claude Code's PreToolUse block/allow semantics:
#   - 0 = allow (exit 0 lets the edit proceed),
#   - 2 = deny (verdict JSON on stderr; Claude Code surfaces stderr to the
#         model as the reason the tool call was blocked),
#   - see run_ironlint below for the full exit-code mapping.
