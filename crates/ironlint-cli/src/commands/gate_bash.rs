//! The `ironlint gate-bash` built-in: read a command on stdin, classify it
//! via `ironlint_bash_gate::decide`, and emit the binary exit contract
//! (0 = allow, 2 = block with the reason on stdout). The adapters' Bash
//! branches shell out to this; it is the single source of the deny decision.
//!
//! Not a `check`: no config load, no trust gate, no per-check spawn. The
//! bash-gate must run even when `.ironlint.yml` is missing or untrusted —
//! that is exactly when the agent is most motivated to run `ironlint trust`.
