# Enforce a minimum *region* coverage threshold on every Rust source file
# under `crates/*/src/`. Region coverage counts distinct decision points
# (branches, short-circuits, match arms) rather than executed lines —
# harder to satisfy with hollow tests that just walk straight-line code.
#
# Used by CI; runnable locally with the same dependencies.
#
# Requires: cargo, cargo-llvm-cov, jq, awk. POSIX-portable; runs on Linux
# (GitHub `ubuntu-latest`) and macOS (`macos-latest` and dev machines).
#
# Configuration:
#   COVERAGE_THRESHOLD — minimum region coverage percent per file (default: 80)
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 — every source file meets the threshold
#   1 — at least one file is below threshold, or a required tool is missing

# Lock numeric formatting so `awk` parses cargo-llvm-cov's JSON decimals
# consistently regardless of the developer's locale settings.
